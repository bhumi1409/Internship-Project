# Implementation of Bank Customer Churn Model
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model of bank customer churn.Â 
Customer churn refers to the phenomenon of customers breaking the relationship with a company. In the banking context, churn prediction is crucial because it helps proactively identify customers who are likely to leave. This allows banks to take proactive steps, such as targeted retention strategies, to retain valuable customers and mitigate revenue loss.

**The main objectives of the project are:**

**Data preprocessing**: Preparing the data set by coding categorical variables, handling unbalanced data to ensure a balanced representation and scaling numerical functions to ensure consistency.

**Model Implementation**: Use the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, a powerful supervised learning algorithm known for efficient classification tasks.

**Performance evaluation:** Evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of the failure prediction model using metrics such as precision, accuracy, recall, and F1 score.

**Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize the performance of an SVM model using grid search by tuning parameters to find the combination that gives the best prediction results.

To achieve these goals, the project aims to provide insight into which techniques (eg, undersampling or oversampling) best solve the imbalanced data problem and which model settings optimize forecast accuracy for bank customer turnover forecasting.
